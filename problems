something wrong with sample[2*N]; and sample[] is initialized by SamplingIndividuals(). and many wired sampleXXX just pops out of NOWHERE. going to do trouble-shooting tomorrow. had to sleep.

Oct 9, 2015, again

previous problem was caused by mistakes on having SAMPLE > N, fixed;
however, float * SiteFrequencySpectrumPrint() seems to return a *local* array; maybe this is causing problem?

Still not figured out why this happens when N = 10, SAMPLE = 5, PROMETHEUS = 10; however, everything works well when N = 100, SAMPLE = 50
Just have no idea at all

================

Wired thing is, it happens sometimes, but not always... wired..

The problem with DivergenceForAll(), should be caused by a single mutation saved multiple times in mutation[block][k], so that mutation[block][i] == mutation[block][i+1] etc. I think.
